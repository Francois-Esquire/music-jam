# Music Jam

**Technical Goals**

- assume that this could be repurposed with other musical apis - go modular
- Separate concerns based on presentation, state, and data layers
- effectively compose components (with the help of context), to delegate rendering updates
- throttle api calls
- store prior results
- MAKE IT PRETTY

**What Needs Work**

- lazy loading down the fold
- animation and a living UI
- Probably a lot more than I can think of atm
